# Weather_Image_Classification_Kaggle
## Curtis Zhuang
This is a Image Classification problem on Kaggle using Deep Learning. 

In this project, I used Tensorflow Keras framework and transfer learning techniques to classify images of different weather patterns. 

The Kaggle dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset.

In this project, I tried both CNN state-of-the-art model EfficientNet and the next step is trying Swin Transformers to test the performance.
